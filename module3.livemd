# Module 3: Functions

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.10"},
  {:kino_vega_lite, "~> 0.1.13"}
])
```

## Preparation

In this notebook we are going to work with anoymous functions. A function is a piece of code that takes zero or more inputs and produces an output.

The following function takes exactly one input and delivers this as its output:

```elixir
fn input -> input end
```

**Note:** Elixir tells us that this one line evaluates to a function. Lets try to assign it to a variable:

```elixir
pipethrough = fn input -> input end
```

This allows us to call it with a concrete value using the `.` operator and at set of parentheses:

```elixir
pipethrough.(42)
```

And yes: Input became output!

We can also define a function that represents the mathematical function $f(x) = 1.2x^2-1.3x+0.9$:

```elixir
f = fn x -> 1.2*x*x - 1.3*x + 0.9 end
```

With this definition in place, we can calculate $f(10)$:

```elixir
f.(10)
```

Now, we can take a sequence of $x$-values, calculate the matching $f(x)$-values, and then convert each matching combination to a map (I do not expect you to understand this code):

```elixir
data =
  -10..10
  |> Enum.map(fn x -> %{"x" => x, "f(x)" => f.(x)} end)
```

We can use the `VegaLite` package to plot these data. For convenience reasons we start by creating an `Vl` alias. That way, we don't have to write `VegaLite` all the time:

```elixir
alias VegaLite, as: Vl
```

Now we can perform the plotting:

```elixir
Vl.new(width: 400, height: 300)
|> Vl.data_from_values(data)
|> Vl.mark(:point)
|> Vl.encode_field(:x, "x", type: :quantitative)
|> Vl.encode_field(:y, "f(x)", type: :quantitative)
```

## Exercise

Implement a `circumference` function that given a radius of a circle calculates the circumference of that circle:

```elixir

```

Pick a smallest and a largest interesting radius, and produce a dataset in the variable `data_circumference` which is in a format that allows it to be plotted:

```elixir

```

Now plot these data:

```elixir

```

Hover the mouse over the last `Vl.encode_field` line until you see a popup. In this popup you will find a `View on Hexdocs` link. Open this link in a new tab. Look through the documentation and figure out how to define a title for an axis.

Make a copy of the previous cell in the cell below, and update it with names for the two axes:

```elixir

```

## Next step ...

One of the above cells looked like this:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
data =
  -10..10
  |> Enum.map(fn x -> %{"x" => x, "f(x)" => f.(x)} end)
```

What does that even mean? We will figure out [here](module4.livemd).
